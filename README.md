# Recruiter on linkedin

## Dear Recruiter,

I really appreciate your time and your effort in reaching out to me. These lines I wrote for help us and avoid wasting our very precious time. 

Right now I’m not looking for a new job, but if you think you can change my mind, be my guest, go ahead.

I noticed that you need these things about me:
- Place where I live
- Resume updated
- English level
- Am I currently employed?
- Salary before taxes.

Well, this text is just a obviously killer list. I will cite my linked profile "https://www.linkedin.com/in/hcamachor/" as my candidate home page.

## About my location
On the third line from my candidate home page, it is indicated where I live. But, it is important to highlight that I will never work in an office again, no exceptions. I will continue in home office because I realized that I'm very happy working from my place.

## About my resume
I don't want to use neither a word template even paper to share my resume, I put a big effort in my candidate home page to be very precise in my experience, education, technology, certifications, and more details to avoid using something else.

## About my english level
Regarding my English level, well these lines are written in english and, in regard to my previous experience, I was working in a couple foreign companies where English is the mother tongue. I have exposed my work and ideas for non-Spanish speakers and my work has been recognized by my colleagues. I know, it’s not perfect, but It is enough to connect with English speakers.

## About salary
It is important talk about salary, I won't give you my expected salary, in my opinion it is rude to ask a candidate for their own price. I completely believe in correspondence, if your company is looking for my skills, at least I hope your company can establish a value for them.

## About my current job
Finally, I will share a bit about my current job relationship. I have an excellent position here, fully balanced between my life and work goals. Aware of my skills and my time. I got wellness, dreams, challenges, amazing training options, a great career growth path, access to labs to learning,  and a good salary.

I won't change that for least than that. 

## Do I want a new job?
If you think I am the best fit, after reading carefully my candidate home page, **I insist, after reading carefully my candidate home page**, I expect a couple of things, a very interesting, readable, challenging, attainable proposal and an interesting salary offer, in accordance with the importance and responsibility of that proposal.

Right after those answers, we will get together and have a serious talk about how to make a deal.

Thanks for your time. Have a nice day.
Héctor.
